## Introduction
In this project, our team has developed a versatile robot that operates under dual control modes: manual and autonomous. Equipped with a Bluetooth interface, the robot can be manually controlled through a dedicated app, allowing users to adjust its speed and direction. A real-time LiDAR sensor continuously monitors the distance to potential obstacles, enabling the robot to halt or navigate around barriers automatically. In its autonomous mode, the robot employs random directional changes to avoid collisions, enriching its capability to maneuver in complex environments. Additionally, the robot features an RGB LED system that indicates its operational status and proximity warnings.
